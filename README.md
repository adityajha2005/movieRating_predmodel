# Movie Rating Prediction Model

## Overview

This project implements a collaborative filtering model to predict movie ratings. The model uses user and movie features to make predictions, employing techniques such as matrix factorization and regularization to improve accuracy.

1. Prepare your dataset and ensure it is in the correct format.

2. To make predictions, use the prediction script:

    ```sh
    python script.ipynb
    ```

## Model Explanation

### Collaborative Filtering

Collaborative filtering is a technique used to predict user preferences by leveraging user-item interactions. This project uses matrix factorization to decompose the user-item interaction matrix into user and item feature matrices.

### Cost Function

The cost function includes the mean squared error between the predicted and actual ratings, along with a regularization term to prevent overfitting:

```python
j = (tf.linalg.matmul(X, tf.transpose(W)) + b - Y) * R
J = 0.5 * tf.reduce_sum(j**2) + (lambda_/2) * (tf.reduce_sum(X**2) + tf.reduce_sum(W**2))
return J
```

### Regularization

Regularization helps to avoid overfitting by adding a penalty to large weights in the feature matrices.

## Dataset

The dataset should include the following matrices:

- `X`: Movie feature matrix (movies x features)
- `W`: User feature matrix (users x features)
- `b`: Bias term
- `Y`: Ratings matrix (movies x users)
- `R`: Indicator matrix (movies x users), where `R(i, j) = 1` if user `j` has rated movie `i`, else `0`.

## Evaluation

The model is evaluated using the mean squared error (MSE) on the validation set. The lower the MSE, the better the model's performance.
